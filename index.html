        <p class="bioText">Hi! Welcome to my page! My name is Shan Indrakumar and I am a developer but definitely not your average one.
            I come from an Accounting background - 10 years of it! But along the way in my wonderful career in 
            commerical real estate working for Canada's largest REIT, I realized it was time to pursue my passions and learn the language
            of the future. So at the age of 30 I began sourcing everything I can on the web to teach myself code.
       </p>
            
        <p class="bioText">It was a bumpy ride at first, because well, I didn't know where to start. I must admit I was stuck and lost
            many many times over. But persistence as with anything in my life was the key. I remained focus and kept hacking away until I 
            landed on a site called freecodecamp. I began following the curriculum and along with some small courses on coursera and codeacademy
            backed by great advice from friends and strangers in the industry I developed a clearer picture of where I was heading.
        </p>

        <p class="bioText"> 3 years later, I have a strong grasp on HTML, CSS and continue to develop on prior strengths in Javascript. As I prepare to 
            enter the industry full time, my journey has landed me at one of the best schools in Canada and enrolled in the inaugural
            Full Stack Development bootcamp. I look forward to this final challenge in my pursuit and excited about what the future has in store!
